# Games-hub

Games Hub is a simple and responsive web page that brings together a bunch of classic JavaScript browser games. I didnâ€™t build the games from scratch, but I created the platform that hosts them, added a clean layout, and made sure it works well on all devices.

This project was more about learning how to structure a multi-page site, use Bootstrap for responsiveness, and improve the overall user experience.

## What I Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Bootstrap

## Why I Made This

I wanted a fun way to practice frontend basics and work on organizing content across different pages. This project helped me get more comfortable with layout design, styling, and making things feel smooth and usable.

## Whatâ€™s Next

Iâ€™m planning to add my own custom games in the future and maybe add a basic score tracking system.

## ðŸ§¾ How to Try It

Just open `index.html` in your browser and explore the games from the homepage.
